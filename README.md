## Tech


The application was developed using the following tools and software:
1. Python: The core programming language used for developing the application.
2. PyQt5/PySide2: A set of Python bindings for the Qt application framework in C++, used for creating 
the graphical user interface (GUI) for the main window of the application.
3. SQLite: A lightweight database engine used for storing and managing tasks on which CRUD 
operations are performed.
4. Qt Designer: A tool for designing and building GUIs from Qt components, which can be used to 
create a more interactive design process.
5. Version Control (Git/GitHub): Used for source code management, allowing for version tracking.
6. Integrated Development Environment (IDE): Visual Studio Code was used for writing and testing 
the code.
